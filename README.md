# * School projects or projects be shared fast&easy *

# for C++ code i mainly use "gcc" to run code : so if u have any problem try to change the compiler
```bash
$ g++ <program.cpp> -o <program>
```
in the c++ code section most of the projects have executable files and u can use them directly, but else u will need to compile them first.
 


many branches can be missing and be created on the go, so dont expect alot
