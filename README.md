#  School projects or projects be shared fast&easy
many branches can be missing and be created on the go, so dont expect alot

## C++
> for C++ code i mainly use "gcc" to run code 
> so if u have any problem try to change the compiler
```bash
$ g++ <program.cpp> -o <program>
```
in the c++ code section most of the projects have executable files and u can use them directly, but else u will need to compile them first.
```bash
$ ./<program>
```
## Go
>for the *Go* codes, some project can use "air" package but its not necessary to have air its just easy to use it than manualy to close the projects and start them again
>but if u insist u can download the air package and use it
>in the *AIR* repo u can finde instruction on how to install and use "air" - https://github.com/cosmtrek/air
