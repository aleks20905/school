# * School projects or projects be shared fast&easy *

# C++
# for C++ code i mainly use "gcc" to run code 
> so if u have any problem try to change the compiler
```bash
$ g++ <program.cpp> -o <program>
```
in the c++ code section most of the projects have executable files and u can use them directly, but else u will need to compile them first.
```bash
$ ./<program>
```
# Go
>for the *Go* codes, some project can use "air" library but its not necessary to have air its just easy to use it than manualy to close the projects and start them again


 


many branches can be missing and be created on the go, so dont expect alot
