#  School projects or projects be shared fast&easy
many branches can be missing and be created on the go, so dont expect alot

## C++
> For C++ code i mainly use "gcc" to run code.
> so if u have any problem try to change the compiler
```bash
$ g++ <program.cpp> -o <program>
```
in the c++ code section most of the projects have executable files and u can use them directly, but else u will need to compile them first.
```bash
$ ./<program>
```
## Go
>For the *Go* codes, some of projects can use "air" package and be confuse so its not necessary to have air its just easy to use it and more convenient than, manualy closeing the project and starting them again etc.
>But if u insist u can download the air package and use it.
>in the *AIR* repo u will find instruction on how to install and use "air" - https://github.com/cosmtrek/air
